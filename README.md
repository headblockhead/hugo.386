# HUGO.386
HUGO.386 is a port of the [BOOTSTRA.386](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386) theme. It has a cool MS-DOS feeling and is ready to be used for blogs. Despite its antique look, the theme is responsive and can be viewed on mobile devices.

## Disclamer:
This theme is designed to work directly with [my blog](https://headblockhead.com/) and is not designed for use with anyone else's hugo site. Use it at your own risk!

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/headblockhead/hugo.386 themes/hugo.386
